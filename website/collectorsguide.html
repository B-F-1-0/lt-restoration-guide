    <h1>Collector's Guide</h1>
        <p>You're likely here because you want to collect as much of the Looney Tunes shorts available on home media as of currently. There's a plethora of DVDs, VHSes, and Blu-rays you feel that you should get, but you have no idea which are the best ones without getting duplicates. Lucky for you, you're in the right place.<br/><br/>There has been various sets in varying degrees of availability, but only certain sets are worth having to expand your library to as maximum as possible. So let's get down to business.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Before we get through with collecting, I have classified a few different tiers of listing the shorts you want to get, being the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="tierheader">Tier 1</span>: The shorts <u>available restored in HD on Blu-ray</u>, which are in the best quality currently possible. This accounts for <strong>283</strong> Golden Age shorts, plus an additional <strong>50</strong> shorts "unofficially" available, of which 21 of these are also available in SD on DVD.</li>
            <li><span class="tierheader">Tier 2</span>: The shorts <u>available restored in SD on DVD</u>, which may not scale well on HD displays. This accounts for <strong>312</strong> Golden Age shorts (of which 21 are available "unofficially" in HD on Blu-ray), plus an additional <strong>18</strong> shorts "unofficially" available.</li>
            <li><span class="tierheader">Tier 3</span>: The shorts <u>available but unrestored on DVD or Blu-ray</u> and thus does not necessarily reflect how the cartoon looks on its original theatrical release. This accounts for <strong>109</strong> Golden Age shorts, most scattered on Warner Archive Collection releases as bonus features.</li>
            <li><span class="tierheader">Tier 4</span>: The shorts <u>available but unrestored on non-DVD or Blu-ray media</u>. These ones are notoriously a lot more harder to obtain or play, as they're often available only on the out-of-print VHSes or Laserdiscs and often look worse than any of the cartoons in the above tier. This accounts for <strong>122</strong> Golden Age shorts.</li>
            <li>A total of <strong>129</strong> Golden Age shorts are not officially obtainable by any means on home media.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on your preferences and whether you prefer having shorts in the best available quality, you may only want home media that fits under tier 1 (and if you're fine with SD prints, tier 2). If you're an extreme completionist, you'll want to go for all tiers although it will be overwhelmingly expensive. If you're new, I recommend focusing on tiers 1 and 2 only, as they're a lot more easier to obtain and also look presentable close to how it would be seen in theaters back in the day. With that out of the way, let's get down to business.</p>
    <h2>Tier 1: HD Shorts</h2>
    <p>
        You'll want to get the following sets, which are ranked by the number of unique shorts:
