        <h1>About this Project</h1>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>This website was created by <a href="https://github.com/B-F-1-0/">BF10</a> for the main purpose of logging the restoration progress of the <em>Looney Tunes</em> shorts, while also maintaining the home media status for the shorts.</p>
        <h2>What is this project about?</h2>
        <p>Throughout the 40 years that the theatrical <em>Looney Tunes</em> shorts came out, over 1000 shorts were produced from the Warner Bros. cartoon studio. Of course, this is an extremely large number of cartoons, and over the years, some (but not all) of the shorts have been released to home media in varying quality.<br/>To learn more about the restoration process and home media, see the <a href="./history.html">history of <em>Looney Tunes</em> restorations here.</a></p>
        <h2>Why did you make this?</h2>
        <p>Perhaps the largest factor was the lack of proper documentation for the restoration process of the shorts altogether. Some people may be familiar with the list of <a href="https://looneytunes.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Warner_Bros._cartoons_that_are_currently_restored_on_DVD_or_Blu-ray_releases">restored</a> and <a href="https://looneytunes.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Warner_Bros._cartoons_that_are_currently_not_restored_on_DVD_or_Blu-ray_releases">non-restored</a> cartoons on the FANDOM wiki. However, FANDOM's recent predatory practices had made navigating the list much more of a pain than necessary (particularly ad infestation for unregistered users and bloatware), plus having gone through various different formats that might be hard to read off.<br/><br/>There are other related websites dedicated to such, including <a href="http://www.dohtem.com/bugs/index.htm">Dohtem's Bugs Bunny Video Guide</a> and <a href="https://frdmtoplay.com/maximizing-bugs-bunny/">Maximizing Bugs Bunny</a>, although they don't necessarily document the best order for getting the shorts available on home media and tend to be outdated.<br/><br/>This project aims to provide up-to-date information about the <em>Looney Tunes</em> shorts restored on home media, while aiming to be the least intrusive option. Additionally, this website aims to document home media that the shorts were included and provide more formal information about them, all in one place.</p>
        <h2>What about post-Golden Age (1970-present) material, such as the television shows and movies?</h2>
        <p>This website is mainly intended for documenting the shorts, particularly of that during the Golden Age (1929-69). Post-Golden Age shorts are documented in a rather limited capacity since they tend to have a much smaller interest to the community than the Golden Age shorts, but still share a similar format to the Golden Age shorts. In recent years, they've also been distributed with the Golden Age shorts on home media.<br/><br/>Television shows and movies are largely out of scope for this project. Most of them are also easily available on home media and/or streaming and for the most part aren't well recieved compared to the Golden Age material and thus less likely to attract any interest. The anthology shows at the time too, such as <em>The Bugs Bunny Show</em>, tend to have their material lost to time and the content of interest, the Golden Age shorts, are largely censored in these shows. As a result, I won't be documenting television shows or movies, and mostly aiming for the shorts.</p>
