        <h1>The History of Restorations and Home Media</h1>
        <p>To get a good glimpse at the process of restoration for the <em>Looney Tunes</em> cartoons, we need to account for their distrbution throughout the television air, onto evolving home media, and the reaction from the fandom. So let's head to the beginning.</p>
        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>In 1929, animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising would be terminated from their positions from Universal Pictures. The duo would start their own cartoon studio, and pitched their first cartoon, "Bosko the Talk-Ink Kid", to several studios. Leon Schlesinger of the Warner Bros. studio would pick up Harman and Ising's pitch, thus beginning <em>Looney Tunes</em> in 1930. A separate series, <em>Merrie Melodies</em>, would also be bought to theaters in 1931, primarily aimed as a rival series for Disney's <em>Silly Syphonies</em>.<br/><br/>Throughout the years, the studio would experience several changes with its staff, adapting to differing styles over its 40 years of production. Nevertheless, the series remained to be harnessed as one of the largest influences of theatrical animation during the Golden Age.</p>
        <p>From this point, we can branch from three different ventures after the series stopped producing new cartoons, which are television airings, home media releases, and the restoration process itself. Learn more by visiting these sections.</p>
