        <h1>The History of Restorations and Home Media</h1>
        <p>To get a good glimpse at the process of restoration for the <em>Looney Tunes</em> cartoons, we need to account for their distrbution throughout the television air, onto evolving home media, and the reaction from the fandom. So let's head to the beginning.</p>
        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>In 1929, animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising would be terminated from their positions from Universal Pictures. The duo would start their own cartoon studio, and pitched their first cartoon, "Bosko the Talk-Ink Kid", to several studios. Leon Schlesinger of the Warner Bros. studio would pick up Harman and Ising's pitch, thus beginning <em>Looney Tunes</em> in 1930. A separate series, <em>Merrie Melodies</em>, would also be bought to theaters in 1931, primarily aimed as a rival series for Disney's <em>Silly Syphonies</em>.<br/><br/>Throughout the years, the studio would experience several changes with its staff, adapting to differing styles over its 40 years of production until the studio shut down in 1969 amid budget concerns. Nevertheless, the series remained to be harnessed as one of the largest influences of theatrical animation during the Golden Age.</p>
        <p>From this point, after the series stopped producing new cartoons, television ventures starting in 1960 bought the cartoons into more public view for years to come, being one of the most memorable Saturday morning cartoons throughout the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. But despite that, a lot of the filmography was out of reach for one to watch their favorites over and over except by luck when the anthology shows were on, lest they had a VHS to record them. Not to mention, they were often censored anyways. So, when did home media come into mind? When did restoration efforts begin? They can be split into two sections here.</p>
        <h2>Restoration history</h2>
        <h3>Early television airings</h3>
        <p>When <em>The Bugs Bunny Show</em> first started airing, Warner Bros. provided cable networks willing to air the anthology show their own prints of the cartoons for networks to air. They were not sourced from the studio's original negatives, but rather from new 35mm prints that would begin to wear down over time as the anthology shows continued to air over the years. It is worth knowing that only post-1948 shorts starting from "You Were Never Duckier" were shipped to these networks, and even then, a good fraction of the shorts within the package were never aired.</p>
        <p>For the very few local networks that could get their hands on the Sunset Productions and Associated Arts Productions, 16mm (Eastmancolor) prints were used, which notably deteriorated at a much faster rate. This is perhaps explains a lot of AAP/Sunset prints resurfacing in recent years to look rather horrid, with large amounts of fade.</p>
        <p>With tape media on the rise by the 1980s, the post-1948 shorts would begin to have their 35mm prints transferred to videotape for television networks to air.</p>
        <h3>VHS/LaserDisc transfers</h3>
        <h3>Dubbed versions</h3>
        <h3>Restoration beginnings</h3>
        <h3>2020 restorations</h3>
        <p>Since 2014, the state of restorations largely became stagnant. Warner Bros. primarily stated this due to low sales of the failed <em>Platinum Collection</em> series and low budgets to restore new cartoons. For at least six years, the shorts that was present on volume 3 of <em>Platinum Collection</em> was the last time anyone saw any newly restored shorts ever come out.</p>
        <p>This wouldn't be until 2020, when Warner Bros. Discovery announced their streaming service, HBO Max. Initially, just cartoons that were previously restored were included on the service. But there was more that was being done on the back.</p>
