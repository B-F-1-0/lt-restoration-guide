        <h1>The History of Restorations and Home Media</h1>
        <p>To get a good glimpse at the process of restoration for the <em>Looney Tunes</em> cartoons, we need to account for their distrbution throughout the television air, onto evolving home media, and the reaction from the fandom. So let's head to the beginning.</p>
        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>In 1929, animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising would be terminated from their positions from Universal Pictures. The duo would start their own cartoon studio, and pitched their first cartoon, "Bosko the Talk-Ink Kid", to several studios. Leon Schlesinger of the Warner Bros. studio would pick up Harman and Ising's pitch, thus beginning <em>Looney Tunes</em> in 1930. A separate series, <em>Merrie Melodies</em>, would also be bought to theaters in 1931, primarily aimed as a rival series for Disney's <em>Silly Syphonies</em>.<br/><br/>Throughout the years, the studio would experience several changes with its staff, adapting to differing styles over its 40 years of production until the studio shut down in 1969 amid budget concerns. Nevertheless, the series remained to be harnessed as one of the largest influences of theatrical animation during the Golden Age.</p>
        <p>From this point, after the series stopped producing new cartoons, television ventures starting in 1960 bought the cartoons into more public view for years to come, being one of the most memorable Saturday morning cartoons throughout the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. But despite that, a lot of the filmography was out of reach for one to watch their favorites over and over except by luck when the anthology shows were on, lest they had a VHS to record them. Not to mention, they were often censored anyways. So, when did home media come into mind? When did restoration efforts begin? They can be split into two sections here.</p>
        <h2>Restoration history</h2>
            <h3>Early television airings</h3>
                <p>When <em>The Bugs Bunny Show</em> first started airing, Warner Bros. provided cable networks willing to air the anthology show their own prints of the cartoons for networks to air. They were not sourced from the studio's original negatives, but rather from new 35mm prints that would begin to wear down over time as the anthology shows continued to air over the years. It is worth knowing that only post-1948 shorts starting from "You Were Never Duckier" were shipped to these networks, and even then, a good fraction of the shorts within the package were never aired.</p>
                <p>For the very few local networks that could get their hands on the Sunset Productions and Associated Arts Productions, 16mm (Eastmancolor) prints were used, which notably deteriorated at a much faster rate. This is perhaps explains a lot of AAP/Sunset prints resurfacing in recent years to look rather horrid, with large amounts of fade.</p>
                <p>With tape media on the rise by the 1980s, the post-1948 shorts would begin to have their 35mm prints transferred to videotape for television networks to air. Some did eventually make it to VHS media. While it did help improve the color balance of the video, this came at a price of a smaller resolution to display the shorts. Not a problem with 80's and 90's televisions at the time since they were designed to be presented in standard definition in mind, but as technology marches on, the resolution difference becomes pretty obvious.</p>

            <h3>Dubbed versions</h3>
            <h3>Restoration beginnings</h3>
            <h3>2020 restorations</h3>
                <p>Since 2014, the state of restorations largely became stagnant. Warner Bros. primarily stated this due to low sales of the failed <em>Platinum Collection</em> series and low budgets to restore new cartoons. For at least six years, the shorts that was present on volume 3 of <em>Platinum Collection</em> was the last time anyone saw any newly restored shorts ever come out.</p>
                <p>This wouldn't be until 2020, when Warner Bros. Discovery announced their streaming service, HBO Max. Initially, just cartoons that were previously restored were included on the service. But there was more that was being done on the back.</p>
                <p>With the streaming service open and a large surge of popularity of <em>Looney Tunes</em> related media on the service (particularly of its then-new 2020 show, <em>Looney Tunes Cartoons</em>), there was now a demand to get more of the classic cartoons on the service. This even included several of the cartoons that wasn't present on Boomerang's streaming service at the time, nor what was seen on TV at the time (even at the time the service launched, Boomerang was practically only rotating the same 25 or so shorts on its <em>Looney Tunes</em> block).</p>
                <p>By the time Warner Bros. found out about this surge of population, there's definitely an audience for the studio to seek out for the classic cartoons. Thus, the plan to restore a lot of the remaining cartoons began.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, this happened to be around the COVID-19 period that caused Warner's in-house studios to be closed for safety purposes. As a result, high quality 35mm transfers of the cartoons were shipped to various outsourced post-production companies that currently remain unknown. Nearly the entire catalog of cartoons were shipped, with perhaps the most notable exceptions being shorts barred from airing on contemporary television for containing harmful outdated ethnic stereotyping. Even some shorts that were restored in SD during the early restoration years (practically up to Volume 2 of Golden Collection) were given another restoration in order to match up to HD standards.</p>
                <p>These restorations would begin to debut on the streaming service around August 2020, with an initial test run of a few newly restored cartoons. Prior to this, only shorts already restored on home media were on the streaming service. Around this time though, viewers began to notice perhaps one of the most controversial moves in the restoration project.</p>
                <p>The restorations were primarily done throughout different post-production companies, so the quality of the restoration themselves largely varied between each other. Wherever it took place, majority of it was done using Adobe software. However, one widespread problem that even casual viewers noticed is that numerous shorts had their title cards appear "zoomed out" heavily. This is from the effects of attempting to fill up the "TV safe" areas, which previously was just a black border on past restorations. Not a problem by itself, however the process that was done to do so was largely deemed amateurish by fans, leading to the term of "photoshopped titles" that refers to cartoons that had extensive photo editing of their title cards to artifically fill out the "TV safe" areas. That aside, other miscellaneous gaffes commonly popped up, with most affecting opening/ending titles. It is largely presumed that these titles were mostly redone digitally due to being cheaper to deal with than restoring the titles frame by frame.</p>
                <p>Depending on the cartoon, the actual cartoon content was mostly restored in a neat condition, with very minimal DVNR compared to past restorations. Perhaps the largest casualty might be from grain removal on some shorts, which may look off-putting for some viewers. Depending on the condition of the cartoon, the colors might have also stayed washed out or the quality of the picture might have been impacted; around this period is when animation buffs found out cartoons such as "Riff Raffy Daffy" had lost its original camera negative, making any chance of getting a clearer version of the short nearly impossible. There are still audio errors, but that can still be blamed on the 1995 Turner dubbed soundtracks and whatever prints was used for Porky Pig 101.</p>
                <p>Restorations using the original negatives would not turn up until the release of the <em>Collector's Choice</em> Blu-ray set around 2022. The first cartoons restored in-house was "Beanstalk Bunny" and "Catch as Cats Can". This process has been done slowly yet surely for the remaining cartoons without a known restoration, which amounts to a little under 200 shorts.</p>
