    <h1>Collector's Guide</h1>
        <p>You're likely here because you want to collect as much of the Looney Tunes shorts available on home media as of currently. There's a plethora of DVDs, VHSes, and Blu-rays you feel that you should get, but you have no idea which are the best ones without getting duplicates. Lucky for you, you're in the right place.<br/><br/>There has been various sets in varying degrees of availability, but only certain sets are worth having to expand your library to as maximum as possible. So let's get down to business.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Before we get through with collecting, I have classified a few different tiers of listing the shorts you want to get, being the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="tierheader">Tier 1</span>: The shorts <u>available restored in HD on Blu-ray</u>, which are in the best quality currently possible. This accounts for <strong>311</strong> Golden Age shorts, plus an additional <strong>57</strong> shorts "unofficially" available, of which 24 of these are also available in SD on DVD.</li>
            <li><span class="tierheader">Tier 2</span>: The shorts <u>available restored in SD on DVD</u>, which may not scale well on HD displays. This accounts for <strong>311</strong> Golden Age shorts (of which 24 are available "unofficially" in HD on Blu-ray), plus an additional <strong>15</strong> shorts "unofficially" available.</li>
            <li><span class="tierheader">Tier 3</span>: The shorts <u>available but unrestored on DVD or Blu-ray</u> and thus does not necessarily reflect how the cartoon looks on its original theatrical release. This accounts for <strong>104</strong> Golden Age shorts, most scattered on Warner Archive Collection releases as bonus features.</li>
            <li><span class="tierheader">Tier 4</span>: The shorts <u>available but unrestored on non-DVD or Blu-ray media</u>. These ones are notoriously a lot more harder to obtain or play, as they're often available only on the out-of-print VHSes or Laserdiscs and often look worse than any of the cartoons in the above tier. This accounts for <strong>102</strong> Golden Age shorts.</li>
            <li>A total of <strong>126</strong> Golden Age shorts are not officially obtainable by any means on home media.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on your preferences and whether you prefer having shorts in the best available quality, you may only want home media that fits under tier 1 (and if you're fine with SD prints, tier 2). If you're an extreme completionist, you'll want to go for all tiers although it will be overwhelmingly expensive. If you're new, I recommend focusing on tiers 1 and 2 only, as they're a lot more easier to obtain and also look presentable close to how it would be seen in theaters back in the day. With that out of the way, let's get down to business.</p>
    <h2>Tier 1: HD Shorts</h2>
      <p>
          You'll want to get the following sets, which are ranked by the number of unique shorts:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="releaseheader">Looney Tunes Platinum Collection</span>: Starting off with the <em>Platinum Collection</em> series, you'll get 135 original cartoons once you work through the rest of the releases below. Most are double dipped from the Golden Collection, but getting the Blu-ray versions ensures you'll be getting the HD versions of the shorts, securing the best altogether right from the start. One problem might be getting the Volume 1 and 2 Blu-rays, which are both currently out-of-print.</li>
        <li><span class="releaseheader">Looney Tunes Collector's Choice</span>: Next up, the ongoing <em>Collector's Choice</em> series nets you 97 original cartoons. Majority of these are not restored on previous home media sets (if they were even released by then), so this is definitely what you'll want to aim for as well.</li>
        <li><span class="releaseheader">Bugs Bunny 80th Anniversary Collection</span>: Most collectors will definitely want to fill up the entirety of Bugs' filmography as much as possible. Getting this set will ensure you fill many gaps with 59 original cartoons, plus 1 post-Golden Age cartoon that is also newly restored.</li>
        <li><span class="releaseheader">Looney Tunes Mouse Chronicles: The Chuck Jones Collection</span>: Finally for the HD tier, 19 original cartoons can be obtained by getting this set. It doesn't feature much of the well known characters, so some may skimp over this one, but it nonetheless can patch up a few holes. Additionally, you'll get one additional cartoon in SD, being the 1998 dubbed version of "Mouse Mazurka".</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Unofficial releases</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="releaseheader">Warner Archive Collection bonuses</span>: Often on Warner Bros. movie releases by Warner Archive, shorts released or themed around the movie might be included. For instance, a movie that takes place in France may include the Pep√© Le Pew or other shorts themed on France, while another released in 1940 may have shorts that were released in 1940, sometimes the ones that aired prior to the movie during theaters at the time. However, there are a lot to list, and some are also available on DVD; just in SD.</li>
      </ol>
    <h2>Tier 2: SD Shorts</h2>
      <p>
          If you're still intersted in getting the shorts available only in SD as of currently without fear they might release in HD in the future, go for the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="releaseheader">Looney Tunes Golden Collection</span>: The pinnacle of all <em>Looney Tunes</em> home media sets, getting the <em>Golden Collection</em> will add a whopping 217 original cartoons onto your library. You also get a lot of bonus features on the side; that's something you really cannot resist.</li>
        <li><span class="releaseheader">Looney Tunes Super Stars</span>: Okay, be careful here. You do <strong>not</strong> want all of the releases in the <em>Super Stars</em> set, as there are a few in there that just double dips from the <em>Golden Collection</em> as one of Warner Home Video's attempts to offset the cost of restoring the cartoons. You want to also be aware that several cartoons in the <em>Hare Extraordinaire</em> and <em>Frustrated Fowl</em> sets are cropped, although several of these have not yet seen a proper fullscreen release yet.<br/>You want to avoid <em>Feline Fwenzy</em> and <em>Wascally Wabbit</em> at all costs; these two consist of nothing but double dips. The rest of the releases are fair game, netting you a total of 97 original cartoons (5 of them cropped). By having all sets above up to this point, you'll practically have a fully complete restoration library, with only two orphan shorts missing from other official sets: "Porky's Duck Hunt" and the uncropped print of "Apes of Wrath".</li>
        <li><strong>Fill in "Apes of Wrath" uncropped and "Porky's Duck Hunt"</strong>: If you really want to fill in these final two cartoons, here are some choices that I'd recommend in no particular order:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="releaseheader">Porky Pig 101</span>: This tier 3 release also comes with the restored version of "Porky's Duck Hunt", and probably the most recommended out of these choices if you're interested in the black-and-white Porky Pig cartoons as well or are aiming for completion purposes.</li>
            <li><span class="releaseheader">Looney Tunes Parodies Collection</span>: To fill in "Apes of Wrath" uncropped, you can get this set which nets you that cartoon alongside several post-Golden Age related media, including the <em>How Bugs Bunny Won the West</em> special. Do note that majority of the post-Golden Age content and new-to-DVD material at the time are unrestored.</li>
            <li><span class="releaseheader">Stars of Space Jam Collection Vol. 1</span>: If you need a cheaper alternative to fill in "Apes of Wrath", this is sufficeable as well.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Unofficial releases</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="releaseheader">His Majesty O'Keefe</span>: This Warner Archive Collection release contains a restored version of "I Gopher You", although it's the 1998 dubbed version. This Burt Lancaster picture comes with this nice bonus if you're a fan of the actor.</li>
        <li><span class="releaseheader">I Love Tweety</span>: These DVDs were released only in Japan and thus will only play on region 2 players. Despite this, modern methods have made it somewhat easier to play and obtain discs from these regions, plus they're still in print in Japan, too. All are available in English and Japanese, and nets you 10 original cartoons, although do note that some are ongoingly being released on the <em>Collector's Choice</em> sets.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Tier 3: Unrestored Shorts</h2>
      <p>
          The above two tiers are usually enough for most contemporary collectors as they're often available without fear of possibly having to double dip for a better print later on. However, that doesn't stop you from continuing from there if you're still interested. However, this will be hefty, so bear with me if you're still interested in the unrestored cartoons.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="releaseheader">Porky Pig 101</span>: Filling in every other black-and-white Porky Pig cartoon with this set, you'll gain 64 original cartoons. Note that several of them, particularly those that aren't deemed offensive for contemporary audiences, has gained a better restored print in 2020 for HBO Max.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill in with unrestored shorts from upper tiers</strong>: Don't forget that most of the above sets comes with bonus features that can include unrestored shorts. <em>Golden Collection</em> particularly nets you 10 original cartoons, and <em>Mouse Chronicles</em> also nets you 9 original cartoons.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Unofficial releases</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="releaseheader">Warner Archive Collection bonuses</span>: Same thing as the Blu-ray releases, except this time, they were released prior to Warner Bros. moving interest to Blu-ray releases around 2012, and before majority were restored in 2020. Some are also censored and/or missing titles, so beware if you're looking to find something as close to the original release.</li>
        <li><span class="releaseheader">4 Classic Cartoons</span>: This extremely rare promo DVD gives you "Snow Excuse" alongside one post-Golden Age cartoon, "The Chocolate Chase". They were intended to feature cartoons that wouldn't see a release later in the <em>Golden Collection</em>, and only these two managed not to appear in <em>Golden Collection</em> or any future sets so far.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Tier 4: Non-DVD/Blu-ray Shorts</h2>
      <p>
          The final tier, which is of course the most expensive and hardest one to get, is only to be aimed for the "hardcore" collectionists who don't mind emptying a fat wallet. All of these are out-of-print, are extremely rare to come by, and if they do, will not come cheap. We do not recommend going for anything in this tier, unless again, you really want the rest of the cartoons for a completely full collection.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="releaseheader">The Golden Age of Looney Tunes</span>: Filling in the rest of the AAP cartoons, getting all volumes of this LaserDisc series will net you 83 original cartoons. Be aware most prints of volume 1 will likely have "Racketeer Rabbit" instead of "Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips" as it was recalled due to controversy with the Japanese American Citizens League.</li>
        <li><span class="releaseheader">The Looney Tunes Video Show and Looney Tunes The Collector's Edition</span>: These two sets of VHS series will fill in practically nearly the rest of the collection, composed of post-1948 cartoons and those in the Sunset package. You'll likely have to carefully cherrypick the volumes so you avoid double dips.</li>
