        <h1>About this Project and FAQ</h1>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>This website was created by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/B-F-1-0/">BF10</a> for the main purpose of logging the restoration progress of the <em>Looney Tunes</em> shorts, while also maintaining the home media status for the shorts.</p>
        <h2>What is this project about?</h2>
            <p>Throughout the 40 years that the theatrical <em>Looney Tunes</em> shorts came out, over 1000 shorts were produced from the Warner Bros. cartoon studio. Of course, this is an extremely large number of cartoons, and over the years, some (but not all) of the shorts have been released to home media in varying quality.<br/>To learn more about the restoration process and home media, see the <a href="./history.html">history of <em>Looney Tunes</em> restorations here.</a></p>
        <h2>Why did you make this?</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the largest factor was the lack of proper documentation for the restoration process of the shorts altogether. Some people may be familiar with the list of <a target="_blank" href="https://looneytunes.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Warner_Bros._cartoons_that_are_currently_restored_on_DVD_or_Blu-ray_releases">restored</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://looneytunes.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Warner_Bros._cartoons_that_are_currently_not_restored_on_DVD_or_Blu-ray_releases">non-restored</a> cartoons on the FANDOM wiki. However, FANDOM's recent predatory practices had made navigating the list much more of a pain than necessary (particularly ad infestation for unregistered users and bloatware), plus having gone through various different formats that might be hard to read off.<br/><br/>There are other related websites dedicated to such, including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dohtem.com/bugs/index.htm">Dohtem's Bugs Bunny Video Guide</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://frdmtoplay.com/maximizing-bugs-bunny/">Maximizing Bugs Bunny</a>, although they don't necessarily document the best order for getting the shorts available on home media and tend to be outdated. Another mention is the specifications of the home media sets themselves, their contents, and a work-in-progress calculator to see which shorts the person are missing/has, which can be useful for collectors.<br/><br/>This project aims to provide up-to-date information about the <em>Looney Tunes</em> shorts restored on home media, while aiming to be the least intrusive option. Additionally, this website aims to document home media that the shorts were included and provide more formal information about them, all in one place. In the end, this is intended as a hub for collectors to know where to get started and to count their collection as a whole.</p>
        <h2>What about post-Golden Age (1970-present) material, such as the television shows and movies?</h2>
            <p>This website is mainly intended for documenting the shorts, particularly of that during the Golden Age (1929-69). Post-Golden Age shorts are documented in a rather limited capacity since they tend to have a much smaller interest to the community than the Golden Age shorts, but still share a similar format to the Golden Age shorts. In recent years, they've also been distributed with the Golden Age shorts on home media.<br/><br/>Television shows and movies are largely out of scope for this project. Most of them are also easily available on home media and/or streaming and for the most part aren't well recieved compared to the Golden Age material and thus less likely to attract any interest. The anthology shows at the time too, such as <em>The Bugs Bunny Show</em>, tend to have their material lost to time and the content of interest, the Golden Age shorts, are largely censored in these shows. As a result, I won't be documenting television shows or movies, and mostly aiming for the shorts.</p>
        <h2>What do you mean by "unofficial criteria" on some of these shorts?</h2>
            <p>There have been heavy debate on whether certain shorts can be considered "widely available on home media", particularly from the following releases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I Love Tweety</strong>, three volumes of DVDs that are exclusive to Japan and can only play on region 2 players.</li>
                <li>The <strong>cropped prints</strong> from the first two Super Stars sets, Hare Extraordinaire and Frustrated Fowl, which infamously loses the video present at the top and bottom of the shorts.</li>
                <li>The bonus cartoons present on <strong>non-<em>Looney Tunes</em> home media releases</strong>, particularly those from Warner Archive Collection. These shorts are often described by the collectors as "orphan" shorts that have been available on home media, but have to actually be placed on home media related to its franchise. Since they largely span towards several different releases that often has low intrinsic value to those not interested in the movies present on the releases, they are considered "unofficial" for the purposes of this website.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In order to avoid debacle for these shorts, I have listed them under "unofficial" releases. Depending on who you ask, they may be considered being on home media or not. For completion purposes, I consider "unofficial" releases its own category that can be added with the officially released shorts.</p>
        <h2>Why are you missing this (public domain/Thunderbean) release?</h2>
            <p>Only official home media releases produced or endorsed by Warner Bros. are included on this website. Grey-market public domain and Thunderbean releases are often produced without authorization or approval from Warner Bros. If you're still interested in these releases, find them at your own risk, but note that they do not follow the same quality standards as Warner Bros. and may be of poorer quality. They will never be documented here as a result.</p>
        <h2>This set with <em>Looney Tunes</em> shorts was announced, can you add it to the site?</h2>
            <p>Not immediately. Shorts on several home media releases, particularly from Warner Archive, tends to be subject to change when officially shipped. To prevent having to go through the mess of updating several pages when a mistake was found, we only add information once a title has been released and reviews confirm the same titles were kept. Any official <em>Looney Tunes</em> sets are the exceptions, as those rarely change.</p>
        <h2>Where can I find these releases?</h2>
            <p>For home media still in print, using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gruv.com/">GRUV Entertainment</a> (the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uphe.com/">Universal Pictures Home Entertainment</a> official marketplace) will be able to provide the most reliable listings that will likely give you a legitimate copy. You may also find Warner Home Video releases available in video store retailers near you. Note that Warner Archive Collection releases are only officially sold on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/ED270804-095F-449B-9B69-6CEE46A0B2BF">Warner Archive's own marketplace</a> on Amazon and a few related online distributors; any Warner Archive releases sold physically in retail are likely counterfeit.<br/><br/>For home media that are out of print, you're primarily on your own for these. Some of them do crop up on auction sites such as <a target="_blank" href="https://ebay.com">eBay</a>, but they will likely not come cheap. Please beware of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spookcentral.tk/tcp/2019/06/25/counterfeit-bootleg-dvd-box-sets">counterfeit releases</a>. You may compare with specifications on this website to see if you have a legitimate release, which has largely been a concern in the collector's community.</p>
        <h2>Will you be doing any other theatrical cartoons, such as Tom & Jerry, MGM, etc.?</h2>
            <p>Currently not in my scope so far, even moreso as this site is under construction.</p>
